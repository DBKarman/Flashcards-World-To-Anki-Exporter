# Flashcards World Exporter
This web application allows you to export your entire library built inside of Flashcards World/Flashcards App to Anki. 

## How it works
This app takes advantage of the Flashcards.World website by exporting the database stored inside Chromeum based browsers, 
it then converts it to a format importable by Anki Desktop App which allows you to sync it to Anki Mobile app
